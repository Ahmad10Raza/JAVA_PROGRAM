# Java Programming and Data Structures

This repository contains Java programs and JSP (Java Server Pages) notes.

## Directory Structure

- `DSA/`: This directory contains Java programs related to various data structures and algorithms. Some of the topics covered include binary search, sorting algorithms (bubble sort, counting sort), patterns (alphabet pattern, diamond pattern, butterfly pattern), and more.
- `JSP/`: This directory contains JSP notes and examples. The `ServletOverview.ipynb` file provides an overview of servlets, including their lifecycle, characteristics, and comparison with CGI (Common Gateway Interface). It also includes examples of a simple servlet and a JSP page.

## Running the Programs

To run the Java programs, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can compile a Java program using the `javac` command and run it using the `java` command.

For example, to run the `Binary_search.java` program, navigate to the `DSA/` directory and run the following commands:

```sh
javac Binary_search.java
java Binary_search
```
